LinkGrab-O-Matic, is a simple interface to quickly and easily post links to your blog as posts. 

== Description ==

I couldn't find a simple way to just add links with a short description 
to my blog without jumping through a lot of hoops. So I made this simple
plugin that makes adding posts to your to site as a link blog post with 
just a few steps.

There's a simple wizard style interface that walks you through the process.

Any image that is used from the source link will be added to the post and 
set as the thumbnail. The image isn't added inline to the post because I 
want you to have more control of how it was displayed. However the image it 
will be in the Media gallery for you to insert.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `linkgrab-o-matic` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Click the new 'Link Grab-o-Matic' option under the Posts menu from your admin screen
1. Rock on!
