LinkGrab-O-Matic, is a simple interface to quickly and easily post links to your blog as posts. 

== Description ==

I couldn’t find a simple way to just add links with a short description to my blog without 
jumping through a lot of hoops. So I made this simple plugin that makes adding posts to your 
to site as a link blog post with just a few steps. That way you could have posts that like 
the popular site Daring Fireball

There’s a simple wizard style interface that walks you through the process.

Any image that is used from the source link will be added to the post and set as the thumbnail. 
The image isn’t added inline to the post because I want you to have more control of how it 
was displayed. However the image will be imported in to the Media gallery for you to insert.

1. Upload the `linkgrab-o-matic` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Click the new 'Link Grab-o-Matic' option under the Posts menu from your admin screen
